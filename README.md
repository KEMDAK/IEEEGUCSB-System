# branch naming patterns

branches starts with naming tokens that identifies which part of the
work flow each branch belongs followed by `/` and then the name of the branch.

#### Branch naming tokens
* **_wip_**       Works in progress; stuff I know won't be finished soon
* **_feat_**      Feature I'm adding or expanding
* **_test_**      testing branch
* **_bug_**       Bug fix or experiment
* **_junk_**      Throwaway branch created to experiment
