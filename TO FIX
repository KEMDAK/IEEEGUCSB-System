To FIX:

+ When creating a user with the same data as one in the database it shouldn't return a 'Internal server error'

+ The return message duo to the SQL validation violation errors is Internal server Error!! (Try to store another committee with the same name)

+ The update function in user controller shouldn't get all the information to update them

+ When password doesn't match it doesn't return anything but it throws an 'Unhandled rejection Not a valid BCrypt hash.' error.

+ Why should we add in the log if the request was a success
