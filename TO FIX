To FIX:

+ When creating a user with the same data as one in the database it shouldn't return a 'Internal server error'

+ The return message duo to the SQL validation violation errors is Internal server Error!! (Try to store another committee with the same name)

+ Validate that the input is phone number

+ Integrate the settings in the store and update functions

+ Should resolve the default value for settings!!!
